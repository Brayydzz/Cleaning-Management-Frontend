          <h1>History Of The Clean Team</h1>
          <p>
            The Clean Team was founded in 1998 by John Smith, making it one of
            the oldest and most experienced residential cleaning companies in
            the Brisbane CBD. After many years of experience in property
            management, John saw a need for a specialized quality local service
            provider to cater for the specific needs of Brisbaneâ€™s booming
            residential market.

              <h3>The Team</h3>
              <p>
                The Clean Team prides itself on the calibre of our cleaners. Not
                only do all of our cleaners undergo the standard criminal
                history and background checks you would expect, but we are very
                particular about only engaging individuals with strong cleaning
                experience which is both independently verifiable via referees.
                Even after applying our strict recruitment standards, we still
                have all candidates undertake our own in-house training to
                ensure they are employing best practices and conforming to The
                Clean Team standards in all of the work they undertake. Unlike
                many cleaning companies, we keep tabs on our top performing
                cleaners so that we can reward them through our industry leading
                cleaner incentive scheme which includes the reward of a $50
                playstation plus voucher!
